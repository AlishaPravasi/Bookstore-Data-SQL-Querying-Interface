# Bookstore-Data-SQL-Querying-Interface

I built a Python GUI (tkinter) that is a front-end querying interface to Henry's Bookstore database. It provides searching by Author, Category, and Publisher. In order to run the interface appropriately download all the data from Henry.sql, then replace your root information for sqlconnector to work in HenryDAO.py, and lastly run Henry.py! I've attached screen captures of the GUI working. 

Dependencies: mysql-connector-python, tkinter
